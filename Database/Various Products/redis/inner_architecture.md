Sure! Let's delve into the inner architecture of Redis in more detail:

Redis follows a client-server architecture, where clients interact with the Redis server to perform various operations on the data stored in Redis. The server is responsible for managing the data structures, executing commands, and coordinating communication with clients.

The inner architecture of Redis consists of several key components:

1. **Client Connections:** Clients connect to the Redis server over a network. Redis supports multiple client connections concurrently, allowing simultaneous operations from different clients.

2. **Command Processing:** Redis processes commands received from clients. Each command is processed atomically and sequentially, ensuring consistency and avoiding race conditions. Redis provides a rich set of commands to perform various operations, such as data retrieval, modification, and transactional operations.

3. **Data Structures:** Redis supports various data structures, including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and more. Each data structure is optimized for specific operations and provides efficient storage and retrieval of data. Redis data structures are implemented using a combination of in-memory data structures and disk-based data structures for persistence.

4. **Memory Management:** Redis's memory management is a crucial aspect of its architecture. Since Redis stores data primarily in memory, it requires efficient memory allocation and management. Redis employs techniques such as memory pooling, memory fragmentation prevention, and optional memory compression to optimize memory usage and improve performance.

5. **Persistence:** Redis offers persistence options to ensure data durability. It supports two main persistence mechanisms: RDB snapshots and Append-Only File (AOF) persistence. RDB snapshots capture the data in memory and save it to disk at specified intervals, while AOF persistence logs every write operation to an append-only file for replaying and reconstructing the dataset.

6. **Replication:** Redis supports replication for high availability and data redundancy. It allows the creation of replica instances that synchronize data with a master instance. Replication provides fault tolerance and enables read scalability by allowing clients to read from replica instances.

7. **Cluster Support:** Redis Cluster is a distributed implementation of Redis that provides automatic sharding and replication across multiple nodes. It enables horizontal scaling and high availability by distributing data and operations across a cluster of nodes.

8. **Eviction Policies:** Redis employs eviction policies to manage memory when it reaches its maximum capacity. When memory is full, Redis can evict less frequently used or least recently used items based on configured eviction policies. This ensures that the most important or frequently accessed data remains in memory.

These components work together to provide efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation in Redis. The specific architecture and interactions may vary depending on the Redis deployment mode (standalone, replicated, or clustered) and configuration settings.

Visualizing the entire Redis architecture can be complex, as it involves interactions between various components. However, the following diagram provides a high-level representation:
