1. **Description:**
   - MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance.
   - It stores data in flexible JSON-like documents, allowing for dynamic schemas and easy data modeling.

2. **Basic Core Concepts:**
   - Document: The basic unit of data storage in MongoDB, represented as a JSON-like structure.
   - Collection: A group of related documents within a database.
   - Database: A container for collections that holds multiple collections.

3. **Major Features/Advantages:**
   - Flexible Schema: MongoDB allows for dynamic and schema-less data models, enabling easy modifications and evolution of data structures.
   - Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability through sharding, allowing you to distribute data across multiple servers for high throughput and large data storage.
   - Rich Query Language: MongoDB offers a powerful query language with support for various query types, including range queries, text search, and geospatial queries.
   - Replication: MongoDB supports automatic replication, providing high availability and data redundancy.
   - Indexing: MongoDB allows you to create indexes on fields to improve query performance.
   - Aggregation Framework: MongoDB's Aggregation Framework provides powerful data aggregation and transformation capabilities, allowing for complex data processing and analysis.

4. **Typical Use Cases with Examples:**
   - Content Management Systems: MongoDB is well-suited for managing content, such as blog posts, articles, and user-generated data.
   - Real-time Analytics: MongoDB can handle high-volume writes and real-time data ingestion, making it suitable for capturing and analyzing streaming data.
   - Catalogs and Product Inventories: MongoDB's flexible schema makes it ideal for managing catalogs and product inventories that require frequent updates and evolving data structures.

5. **Disadvantages or Features Lacking:**
   - Join Operations: MongoDB doesn't support traditional SQL-style joins. Instead, it encourages denormalization and embedding related data within documents.
   - Transactions: While MongoDB introduced multi-document ACID transactions in recent versions, it's not as mature or widely used as in traditional relational databases.
   - Memory Consumption: MongoDB's memory usage can be relatively high due to its in-memory storage engine.

6. **Inner Architecture with Visualization:**
   - MongoDB employs a distributed architecture that utilizes replica sets for high availability and sharding for horizontal scalability. Each replica set consists of multiple MongoDB nodes, including primary and secondary nodes. Sharding distributes data across multiple shards, each consisting of replica sets.
   - Here is a simplified visualization of MongoDB's architecture:
