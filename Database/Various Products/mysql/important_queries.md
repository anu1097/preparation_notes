Sure, here are some of the most important queries in PostgreSQL:

* **SELECT:** This query is used to select data from a database. The SELECT statement is the most basic and essential SQL query.
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
* **UPDATE:** This query is used to update data in a database. The UPDATE statement is used to change the values of existing rows in a table.
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column_name = new_value WHERE condition;
```
* **DELETE:** This query is used to delete data from a database. The DELETE statement is used to remove rows from a table.
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
* **INSERT INTO:** This query is used to insert data into a database. The INSERT INTO statement is used to add new rows to a table.
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
```
* **CREATE TABLE:** This query is used to create a new table in a database. The CREATE TABLE statement is used to define the structure of a table.
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1 datatype,
  column2 datatype,
  column3 datatype,
  ...
);
```
* **ALTER TABLE:** This query is used to modify an existing table in a database. The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add new columns, remove columns, or change the data type of columns in a table.
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
```
* **DROP TABLE:** This query is used to delete a table from a database. The DROP TABLE statement is used to remove a table from a database.
```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

These are just some of the most important queries in PostgreSQL. There are many other queries that you can use to manage and maintain your PostgreSQL database.
