Some of the key differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL:

* **Architecture:** MySQL is a purely relational database, whereas PostgreSQL is an object-relational database. This means that PostgreSQL offers more sophisticated data types, and lets objects inherit properties. On the flip side, it also makes it more complex to work with PostgreSQL.
* **Data types:** MySQL supports a limited set of data types, while PostgreSQL supports a wider range of data types, including JSON, XML, and geometric data types.
* **Features:** PostgreSQL supports a wider range of features than MySQL, including foreign key constraints, triggers, and stored procedures.
* **Performance:** MySQL is generally faster than PostgreSQL for read-only queries, while PostgreSQL is generally faster for read-write queries and complex queries.
* **Scalability:** PostgreSQL is more scalable than MySQL, and can handle more data and more users.
* **Licensing:** MySQL is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), while PostgreSQL is licensed under the MIT License.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL:

| Feature | MySQL | PostgreSQL |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | Relational | Object-relational |
| Data types | Limited | Wide range |
| Features | Limited | Wide range |
| Performance | Faster for read-only queries | Faster for read-write queries and complex queries |
| Scalability | Less scalable | More scalable |
| Licensing | GPL | MIT |

If you need a database that is fast for read-only queries, then MySQL may be a good choice. If you need a database that is scalable and supports a wide range of features, then PostgreSQL may be a better choice.

MySQL does support foreign key constraints, triggers, and stored procedures. However, the implementation of these features in MySQL is not as robust as the implementation in PostgreSQL. For example, MySQL does not support cascading deletes or updates for foreign keys, and the syntax for triggers and stored procedures is more complex in MySQL than in PostgreSQL.

In general, PostgreSQL provides a more comprehensive set of features than MySQL. However, MySQL is a simpler database to learn and use, and it is often faster for read-only queries.

Here is a table that summarizes the differences between the implementation of foreign key constraints, triggers, and stored procedures in MySQL and PostgreSQL:

| Feature | MySQL | PostgreSQL |
|---|---|---|
| Foreign key constraints | Supported, but not as robust as in PostgreSQL | Supported, and supports cascading deletes and updates |
| Triggers | Supported, but the syntax is more complex | Supported, and the syntax is simpler |
| Stored procedures | Supported, but the syntax is more complex | Supported, and the syntax is simpler |
