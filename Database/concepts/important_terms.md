1. **Throughput**: The term "throughput" generally refers to the amount of work or data that can be processed or transferred within a given time period. It is often used in the context of computing, networking, and systems analysis. In computing, throughput can refer to the rate at which data is processed or transferred, usually measured in terms of bits, bytes, or operations per second. In networking, throughput represents the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given time. The higher the throughput, the more efficient and faster the system or network is considered to be.

2. **Latency**: Latency refers to the time delay between the initiation of a task and its completion. It is often used to measure the responsiveness or speed of a system. Low latency is desirable as it indicates faster processing or communication. 
 
3. **Scalability**: Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing workloads or accommodate growth without significant performance degradation. It involves designing systems that can efficiently handle increased demands by adding resources or expanding infrastructure. 
 
4. **Redundancy**: Redundancy involves duplicating critical system components or data to ensure fault tolerance and high availability. By having redundant systems, failures can be mitigated, and the system can continue to operate without interruptions. 
 
5. **Security**: Security encompasses measures taken to protect systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or breaches. It involves implementing authentication, encryption, access controls, and other practices to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 
 
6. **Optimization**: Optimization involves improving the performance and efficiency of systems, algorithms, or code. It can include techniques such as algorithmic optimizations, code profiling, caching, and resource utilization improvements to achieve faster execution or reduced resource consumption. 
 
7. **Version Control**: Version control is a system that manages changes to source code or files over time. It allows developers to track modifications, collaborate, and revert to previous versions if needed. Popular version control systems include Git, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial. 
 
8. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: CI/CD is a software development practice that involves automating the build, testing, and deployment of code changes. It aims to ensure that code changes are integrated and deployed quickly, reliably, and with minimal manual intervention.
